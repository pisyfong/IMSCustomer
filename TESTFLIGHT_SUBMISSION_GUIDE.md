## üåê Building iOS App from Windows (Using Codemagic)

Since you're on Windows, the easiest way is to use **Codemagic** (free for open source):

### Quick Setup:

1. **Create Codemagic Account**
   - Go to https://codemagic.io
   - Sign up with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

2. **Push Your Code to Git**
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\J9G0014\Documents\IMScust\IMSCustomer
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for iOS build"
   # Push to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
   ```

3. **Connect Repository to Codemagic**
   - In Codemagic dashboard, click "Add application"
   - Select your repository
   - Choose Flutter as framework

4. **Configure iOS Build**
   - Select iOS as platform
   - Add your Apple Developer credentials
   - Upload signing certificates and provisioning profiles
   - Or use Codemagic's automatic code signing

5. **Start Build**
   - Click "Start new build"
   - Wait for build to complete (10-20 minutes)
   - Download IPA or publish directly to TestFlight

### Alternative: Use GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/ios-build.yml`:
```yaml
name: iOS Build
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```
